* [Simple MC](https://github.com/r3versi/critical-phenomena-mc/blob/master/ising2D/simple.cpp): simple local moves (not fit to simulate the system near its critical point)
* [Swendsen-Wang](https://github.com/r3versi/critical-phenomena-mc/blob/master/ising2D/swendsen_wang.cpp): cluster algorithm for non-local moves ([paper](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.58.86))
* [Wolff](https://github.com/r3versi/critical-phenomena-mc/blob/master/ising2D/wolff.cpp): improvement of Swendsen-Wang algorithm to speed the sampling around critical point
