MC simulations for critical phenomena 
====

This repository is a collection of assignments for the [Numerical Methods](http://people.na.infn.it/~decandia/corsi/MNF/programma.html) exam.

We implemented several simulations to investigate the behaviour of physical systems undergoing phase transitions (PT) near their critic points.
